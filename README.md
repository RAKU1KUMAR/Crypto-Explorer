## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Crypto Explorer runs directly in modern web browsers without the need for additional dependencies. For development and real-time preview, it is recommended to use a code editor with live reload functionality (such as Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone https://github.com/bocaletto-luca/crypto-explorer.git cd crypto-explorer


2. **Launch the Application**

- Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
- Alternatively, use a live reload server provided by your code editor to preview changes in real time.

## How It Works

- **Data Fetching:** The application leverages the Fetch API to retrieve real-time cryptocurrency data from free public APIs like CoinGecko. The JSON response is parsed to display current market values and historical data.
- **Interactive Charts:** Chart.js is utilized to create interactive graphs that show price trends and market movement over time, giving users clear visual insights.
- **Dynamic Details Modal:** A modal window displays comprehensive details for each cryptocurrency when a user clicks on its card. This includes additional metrics, performance charts, and historical analysis.
- **Search and Filtering:** Users can search for cryptocurrencies by name or symbol, and further filter results based on market performance and other metrics.
